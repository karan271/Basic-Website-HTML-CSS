<h1>&raquo;FAQs(Frequently Ask Question)</h1>
<ul>
<h3> Ques: Why save tigers?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br>
Tigers are terminal consumers in the ecological food pyramid, and their conservation results in the conservation of all trophic levels in an ecosystem. </p>
<div id="blah"></div><br>

<li>
<h3> Ques: What is Project Tiger?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br>Project Tiger is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme of Government of India which was launched on the 1st of April, 1973 for in-situ conservation of wild tigers in designated tiger reserves.</p>
</li>
<div id="blah"></div><br>
<li>
<h3> Ques: Which are the States where Project Tiger is implemented?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br>Wild tigers are found in 18 of our States, viz. Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mizoram, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.  Project Tiger is being implemented in these States in collaboration with the respective State Governments.  </p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Ques: Where do you find tigers in India?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br>Tigers are found in a variety of habitats, including tropical and sub tropical forests, evergreen forests, mangrove swamps and grasslands. In India, tigers are found in 19 states. For the better management of tiger habitats, forests have been demarcated as Tiger reserves, National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries, also known as Protected Areas. There are 39 Tiger Reserves in our country today, some of which were added recently. </p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Ques : What is the strategy adopted for tiger conservation in Project Tiger?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br> Broadly, the strategy involves exclusive tiger agenda in the core/critical tiger habitat, inclusive people-wildlife agenda in the outer buffer, besides fostering the latter agenda in the corridors.  This strategy / roadmap is reflected in a tiger reserve specific Tiger Conservation Plan for each reserve prepared under section 38V of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.  </p>
</li>
<div id="blah"></div><br>
<li>
<h3>Ques: What kind of support is provided under Project Tiger?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br> Under Project Tiger, 100% central assistance is provided for non-recurring items of expenditure to the States, besides 50% matching grant for recurring items (90% for North Eastern States), based on the Annual Plan of Operations of tiger reserve, proposed by the State vis-a-vis the Tiger Conservation Plan.  </p>
</li>
<div id="blah"></div><br>
<li>
<h3>Ques: What is the role of National Tiger Conservation Authority?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br>The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) is a statutory body of the Ministry, with an overarching supervisory / coordination role, performing functions as provided in the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.</p>
</li>
<div id="blah"></div><br>
<li>
<h3>Ques: How do we count our tigers?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br>The day to day administration / management / field interventions / protection are done by the State officials in field formations (tiger reserves), as the land belongs to States.  The role of Project Tiger / NTCA is to provide technical guidance and funding support.  However, the following are ensured at the level of NTCA / Project Tiger (GOI)</p>
<p>Alerting the States as and when required
<br><b>o</b>    Transmitting backward / forward linkages of information relating to poachers
<br><b>o</b>    Advising the States for combing forest floor to check snares / traps
<br><b>o</b>    Performing supervisory field visits through the National Tiger Conservation Authority and its regional offices
<br><b>o</b>    Providing assistance to States for antipoaching operations
<br><b>o</b>    Using information technology for improved surveillance (e-Eye system) using thermal cameras
<br><b>o</b>    Launching tiger reserve level monitoring using camera trap to keep a photo ID database of individual tigers
<br><b>o</b>    Preparing a national database of individual tiger photo captures to establish linkage with body parts seized or dead tigers
<br><b>o</b>    Assisting States to refine protection oriented monitoring through monitoring system for tigers intensive protection and ecological status (M-STrIPES)
<br><b>o</b>    Providing grant through NTCA for patrolling in tiger rich sensitive forest areas outside tiger reserves
<br><b>o</b>    Assisting States to deploy local workforce in a big way for protection to complement the efforts of field staff [In all, approximately 24 lakh mandays are generated annually with 50% central assistance amounting to around Rs. 24 crores (excluding matching 50% share given by States) under Project Tiger.  Many local tribes constitute such local workforce (besides non-tribals), eg. Baigas, Gonds in Madhya Pradesh, Gonds in Maharashtra, Chenchus in Andhra Pradesh, Sholigas in Karnataka, Gujjars in Uttarakhand and Irulas in Tamil Nadu to name a few].
<br><b>o</b>    Supporting States for raising, arming and deploying the Special Tiger Protection Force</p>

<h3>Ques: How do we monitor our wild tigers?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br> Besides the once in four years snapshot country level assessment, the tigers are monitored in tiger reserves through a special field protocol (Phase-IV monitoring) which involves recording day to day field evidences in prescribed format, collating camera trap pictures of tigers, collection of scat samples in difficult areas, besides using smart patrolling protocols like M-STrIPES in some reserves.  Every tiger reserve has a catalogue of camera trap photo capture of individual tiger.  </p>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Ques: What are the challenges facing wild tiger conservation?</h3>
<p><b>Ans:</b><br>The challenges include: protection against poaching, fragmentation of habitat, securing inviolate space for tiger to facilitate its social dynamics, addressing tiger-human interface, restoration of corridors and eliciting public support of local people by providing ecologically sustainable options.  </p>
